# Being a judge at Hack4Tomorrow hackathon

I was fortunate to be invited as a Judge for the Hack4Tomorrow hackathon conducted by Excel 2023

This was a nice new experience.&#x20;

From participating in hackathons to Organizing them to now finally Judging one!

It was a good hackathon. Nice projects

After discussing among the judges, we finalized a few projects for the prize money. But I felt a bit sad thinking of the other teams who didn't win. I don't think I'd want to go into judging again if possible. The judges may have valid reasons to select certain projects, but it's hard for other participants to directly understand them I feel. Especially since they spent so much effort in the past 24-48 hours on their work in the hopes to win the prize.

Since I've been on both sides, I personally would prefer to stay against judging I think.&#x20;
