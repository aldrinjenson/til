# Honours degree from Education Minister

Honours was nice. I like the subject plus it was taught by Sreekumar Sir who is a very nice teacher.

Since our university was so large, I never expected to have a proper convocation.&#x20;

Fortunate that they went ahead with giving it to the 200 or so Honours degree holders from the state.
