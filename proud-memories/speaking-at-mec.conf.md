# Speaking at MEC.Conf

This was one of the great memories!

I was invited to give a talk on Free and Open Source Software(FOSS) to an audience of around 150 people.&#x20;

At first I was very hesitant. I gave the volunteers the contact number of a lot of other people. Still in the end it came back to me due to multiple reasons.I spent days making a good presentation.

And it paid off! it paid off big time!!



​This was one of the happiest moments. At the end of the talk, I got such great feedback that i was very proud and happy!

I talked about FOSS, the origins, the 4 freedoms, why one should care, how to get started etc. This was a topic that was very close to my heart.

&#x20;I was heavily inspired by a good friend Abraham Raji and a lot of very enthusiastic people from the FOSS community; because of which all the efforts put into the talk was very much worth it I feel.&#x20;

I took several real life example and analogies (4 Freedoms through a Masala Dosa example) to make the concepts be much clear and relatable.
